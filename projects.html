    <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>In order to learn HTML and CSS, I created this website. This website
      represents a resum&eacute; that I can constantly update and share
      easily. It also provides me a place to test out new web developement
      techniques and concepts. Click the button below to see the annotated
      source code for this project!</p>

      <h3>Documentary Filmmaking</h3>
      <p>Through Northeastern's Global Experience, I spent 5 weeks in London
        during the summer of 2019. During this time, I took a class titled
        "Documentary Filmmaking" and produced a documentary on the effect
        Grime music has had on British youth and culture as a whole.</p>

        <h3>Engineering Design and Development</h3>
        <p>For my Senior Capstone in the Project Lead the Way curriculum, I was
          challenged to develop a problem statement pertaining to the theme of
          "wellness". I then used the Engineering Design Process paired with
          Agile and Essential Scrum project management techniques
          to develop a minimal viable solution.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>User Interviews:</b> We obtained data and feedback from
            wheelchair users by conducting both online surveys and in person
            interviews at local wheelchair rugby tournaments and connecting
            with members of the Paralyzed Veterans of America.</li>
            <li><b>Problem Statement:</b> "In areas that are not up to the accessibility code
              defined by ADA, manual wheelchair users, without assistance or training
              to learn to vertically jump their wheelchair, are unable to navigate
              vertical ledges (i.e. curbs, sidewalks, and landings)."</li>

              </div>
              <li><b>Design Criteria:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>Performance: The solution must get the user up a curb in
                    less than 30 seconds without outside assistance.</li>
                    <li>Safety: The solution cannot cause the wheelchair to tip,
                      or cause damage to the wheelchair or user.</li>
                      <li>Ergonomics: The solution must not require the user to
                        exert a force greater than the 25th percentile
                        in any direction.</li>
                        <li>Size & Weight: The solution must not weigh more than
                           ten pounds, or add to the overall width of the chair.</li>
                           <li>Cost: The solution must cost less than $250
                             to the consumer.</li>
                           </ul>
