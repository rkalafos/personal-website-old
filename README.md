# personal-website
a collection of my personal achievements, experiences, and information

I created this project as a way to practice and demonstrate my proficiency in HTML and CSS.
This website contains four sections, containing the following information:
1) Home - biography and academic information
2) Projects - some of my larger projects
3) Resume - where people can download a printable version of my resume
4) Contact - a way people can contact me

In summary, this project is the website version of a resume!
